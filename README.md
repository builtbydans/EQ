## Comments

This project allowed me to utilise a framework not used before: MaterialUI. The research process here created a few obstacles and there were moments when CSS was preferred over MUI (mainly due to the time-constraint in building this project c. 3 hours).

In a revised version, the following features would be addressed:

- Mobile responsiveness
- Animations for clearer UX
- A modal or different UI design choice that extends from 'Learn More'
- Being able to implement better DRY principles
- More separation of concerns by isolating the data
